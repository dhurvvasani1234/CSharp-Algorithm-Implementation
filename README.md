# CSharp-Algorithm-Implementation


## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of three core algorithms in C#:
1. **Bubble Sort** - A sorting algorithm.
2. **Linear Search** - A search algorithm that scans sequentially.
3. **Binary Search** - An optimized search algorithm for sorted arrays.

## Features
- Demonstrates sorting and searching in arrays.
- Explains the comparison counts for each algorithm.
- User interaction for dynamic input.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
